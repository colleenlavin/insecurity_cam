"# insecurity_cam" 
This is a hackathon project for learning tessel. 
Our goal was to make the silliest, least useful project we could in three and a half hours.
So we built the Insecurity Camera, a security camera that turns away whenever it senses people/noise.
Much of the code is based off of sample tutorials provided by Tessel. 
Nevertheless, it was a blast to build.
